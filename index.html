        <h2>What is a Life Calendar?</h2>
        <p>A life calendar is a way to visualize your life in weeks or months, helping you reflect and plan intentionally.</p>

        <h2>Why Visualize Your Life in Months?</h2>
        <p>Seeing each month of your life laid out helps you appreciate your time, stay focused, and make better choices.</p>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is this meant to be depressing?</h3>
            <p>Not at all! While seeing your life visualized can be sobering, most users report feeling motivated and inspired. Awareness of life's finite nature often leads to more meaningful choices and greater appreciation for each day.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How accurate is the visualization?</h3>
            <p>The grid accurately represents the months you've lived based on your birthdate. Of course, no one knows exactly how long they'll live, so the total length is based on average life expectancy. This isn't meant to be predictive but rather to provide perspective.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I save or share my visualization?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Once you create your visualization, you can download it as an image or share a unique link with friends and family. Many users find that sharing leads to meaningful conversations about time and priorities.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. We ask for your birthdate to create the visualization, but this is a static page and we don't store any information.</p>
